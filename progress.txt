Project initialized with Ralph workflow.

- Created `plan.md` - project plan and tasks
- Created `progress.txt` - progress tracking log

Next: Begin working on first task.

## Session 1

### Tasks completed in this session
- Fixed type errors in `src/services/git.ts` by adding `as const` assertions to `checkStatus` return values to match the `readonly` `RepoStatus` schema types
- Fixed type guard `isRepoStatus` in `src/components/repo-item.tsx` to use proper type narrowing with `typeof status === "object"` check instead of `in` operator
- Fixed test errors in `src/services/git.test.ts` by adding proper type checks for `unknown` error types using `instanceof Error` guards

### Decisions made and why
- Added `as const` assertions to git.ts return values: The `RepoStatus` schema uses `readonly` properties, but the `checkStatus` function was returning plain objects. Using `as const` makes the returned objects have `readonly` properties, matching the schema type.
- Changed type guard implementation: The `in` operator wasn't working correctly with union. Using `typeof status === "object" && types in TypeScript status !== null && "state" in status` properly narrows the type.
- Used `instanceof Error` for error type checking: Bun's test framework requires proper type narrowing for `unknown` types before calling methods like `toString()`.

### Blockers encountered
- None significant; type system issues were resolved by proper type narrowing and const assertions.

### Files changed
- `src/services/git.ts` - Added `as const` assertions to return values
- `src/components/repo-item.tsx` - Fixed type guard implementation
- `src/services/git.test.ts` - Added type guards for error handling

## Session 2

### Tasks completed in this session
- Updated keybindings in `src/lib/keybinds.ts`: Changed `repo-sync` from "enter" to "s", and `repo-sync-all` from "s" to "S" (Shift+s)

### Decisions made and why
- Mapped lowercase "s" to sync the highlighted repository: Aligns with requirement that `s` syncs the currently highlighted repository
- Mapped uppercase "S" (Shift+s) to sync all repositories: Aligns with requirement that `S` syncs ALL repositories sequentially or in parallel

### Blockers encountered
- None; keybinding changes were straightforward

### Files changed
- `src/lib/keybinds.ts` - Updated key mappings for repo-sync and repo-sync-all

---

## Session 3

### Tasks completed in this session
- Implemented "Sync All" feature in `src/components/repo-list.tsx`: Added keyboard handler for "repo-sync-all" action that iterates over all repositories and triggers clone or pull based on each repo's status

### Decisions made and why
- Used `isRepoStatus` type guard to differentiate between RepoStatus objects and other types: Matches the pattern already established in repo-item.tsx
- Used fire-and-forget pattern with `void` for sync operations: Sync operations can take time, blocking the UI would provide poor user experience; this allows the user to continue navigating while syncs run in background
- Iterated synchronously through repos and triggered parallel sync operations: Each repo sync runs independently, maximizing throughput while keeping the implementation simple

### Blockers encountered
- None significant; initial Effect handling required understanding the Effect runtime pattern, which was resolved by examining existing code patterns in repo-item.tsx

### Files changed
- `src/components/repo-list.tsx` - Added "repo-sync-all" keyboard handler, isRepoStatus type guard function

---

## Session 4

### Tasks completed in this session
- Removed hardcoded background color from `src/app.tsx` to allow terminal transparency

### Decisions made and why
- Removed `backgroundColor={bgColor()}` from main box element: The plan specified the main background should be transparent to match the terminal background
- Removed unused `useTheme` import and `theme` const: LSP flagged these as unused after the background color removal
- Highlighted items already use `theme.bg[3]` with bold text: The highlighting in repo-item.tsx already handles visibility against transparent backgrounds

### Blockers encountered
- None; LSP errors were resolved by cleaning up unused code

### Files changed
- `src/app.tsx` - Removed backgroundColor prop, removed unused useTheme import and theme const

---

## Session 5

### Tasks completed in this session
- Fixed highlighting in `src/components/repo-item.tsx`: Changed from using terminal-dependent `theme.bg[3]` to a fixed highlight color `#334455` that provides clear visibility against any terminal background

### Decisions made and why
- Used fixed color `#334455` for highlighting: The previous implementation used `theme.bg[3]` which was calculated from the terminal background color. This could result in poor contrast on dark terminals (light gray on dark gray). The new blue-gray color `#334455` provides consistent, clear highlighting on both dark and light terminal backgrounds.
- Added padding to the main box element: Added `paddingLeft={1} paddingRight={1}` to match the visual spacing pattern used in other OpenTUI examples and provide better visual separation.

### Blockers encountered
- None significant; TypeScript initially complained about `null` values for backgroundColor, which was resolved by using the string "transparent" instead.

### Files changed
- `src/components/repo-item.tsx` - Changed highlight color to fixed `#334455`, added horizontal padding
