Completed: Implement GitService with clone, pull, and checkStatus methods

- Created src/services/git-service.ts with:
  - Repo interface for repository data
  - GitService interface with clone, pull, checkStatus methods
  - GitError type for error handling
  - clone: Uses git clone --quiet to clone repos to target directory
  - pull: Uses git -C <dir> pull --quiet to pull latest changes

  - live Layer that provides GitService using CommandExecutor

The service uses @effect/platform Command and CommandExecutor for git operations.
Type checks and lint passed.

- Created src/services/config-service.ts with:
  - Config interface for repository list configuration
  - ConfigService interface with load, addRepo, removeRepo methods
  - ConfigError type for error handling
  - parseRepoName: Extracts repository name from Git URL
  - load: Reads .context/config.json or returns default empty config
  - addRepo: Parses URL, adds repo to config, saves to file
  - removeRepo: Removes repo from config, saves to file
  - live Layer that provides ConfigService using CommandExecutor

  - Keyboard navigation hints in the footer
  - Uses OpenTUI SolidJS components (box, text) with SolidJS control flow (For, Show)

  - checkAllStatuses: Checks sync status for all repos using GitService
  - handleAddRepo: Adds new repo via ConfigService and clones via GitService
  - handleSyncRepo: Syncs selected repo (clone if missing, pull if existing)
  - handleSelect: Updates selected repository index
  - Keyboard navigation (j/k for up/down, a for add, enter for sync, escape for cancel)
