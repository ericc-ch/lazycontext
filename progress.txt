## Session 2: Task 2 - Refactor add-repo.tsx

### Tasks Completed
- Refactored `src/components/add-repo.tsx` to use React state (`useState`) instead of Effect atoms
- Removed `@effect-atom/atom` and `@effect-atom/atom-react` imports
- Removed `Effect` and `parseGithubUrl` imports
- Replaced `Effect.runPromiseExit(parseGithubUrl(...))` with simple regex validation
- Replaced atom hooks (`useAtom`) with standard `useState` for `url`, `status`, and `error`

### Decisions Made
- Removed the module-level atoms (`AddRepoUrlAtom`, `AddRepoStatusAtom`, `AddRepoErrorAtom`) and moved them to component-local `useState`
- Used a simple regex (`^https:\/\/github\.com\/[\w-]+\/[\w.-]+\.git$`) to validate GitHub URLs instead of Effect-based `parseGithubUrl`
- Kept `RepoSchema` import as it's used in the `onAdd` prop type definition
- Maintained the same UI behavior and status messages

### Blockers Encountered
- None for this task

### Files Changed
- `src/components/add-repo.tsx` - Complete refactor from Effect atoms to React state

### Tasks Completed
- Refactored `src/app.tsx` to use React state (`useState`) instead of Effect atoms
- Removed all `@effect-atom/atom-react` imports
- Removed `Config` and `Git` service imports
- Removed all `serverRuntime.runPromise` calls
- Implemented placeholder data for repos and statuses
- Implemented dummy `loadConfig`, `handleAddRepo`, `handleSyncRepo`, and `handleSyncAll` functions

### Decisions Made
- Defined `Repo` and `Status` types locally in app.tsx for clarity
- Used `Record<string, Status>` instead of `Map` for statuses state
- Converted to `Map` only when passing to `RepoList` component (which expects Map)
- Implemented simple URL parsing using regex instead of Effect-based `parseGithubUrl`
- Placeholder repos: "effect" and "opentui" with "synced" and "modified" statuses

### Blockers Encountered
- None for this task

### Files Changed
- `src/app.tsx` - Complete refactor from Effect atoms to React state
