2026-01-16: Fixed src/components/provider-theme.tsx - Created missing `createDefaultPalette` function in src/lib/color.ts to provide proper initial value for theme resource. Updated plan.md, ran typecheck, lint, and tests - all pass.

2026-01-16: Updated src/app.tsx - Replaced hardcoded backgroundColor "#0f0f14" with theme color using useTheme() hook and ThemeProvider. Added rgbaToHex helper in src/lib/color.ts for color conversion. Ran typecheck, lint, and tests - all pass.

Next: Update src/components/status-bar.tsx
