## Session 1

### Tasks completed
- Task 1: Update Dependencies and Configuration

### Decisions made and why
- Updated dependencies before refactoring source code to ensure React packages were available before migration
- Used `bun remove` and `bun add` commands as specified in plan.md for dependency management

### Blockers encountered
- None - dependency updates completed successfully

### Files changed
- package.json: Removed solid-js and @opentui/solid, added react, @types/react, and @opentui/react
- tsconfig.json: Changed jsx from "preserve" to "react-jsx" and jsxImportSource from "@opentui/solid" to "@opentui/react"
