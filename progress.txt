Completed: Implement GitService with clone, pull, and checkStatus methods

- Created src/services/git-service.ts with:
  - Repo interface for repository data
  - GitService interface with clone, pull, checkStatus methods
  - GitError type for error handling
  - clone: Uses git clone --quiet to clone repos to target directory
  - pull: Uses git -C <dir> pull --quiet to pull latest changes
  - checkStatus: Returns "synced", "modified", or "missing" status
  - live Layer that provides GitService using CommandExecutor

The service uses @effect/platform Command and CommandExecutor for git operations.
Type checks and lint passed.
