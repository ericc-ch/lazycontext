2026-01-18:
- Tasks completed:
  - Task 1: Infrastructure Setup - Added RegistryProvider wrapper to src/main.tsx
- Decisions made:
  - Chose Task 1 as highest priority because it's the foundational infrastructure that enables all atom usage
  - Used basic RegistryProvider without initialValues for now (can be added later when atoms are defined)
- Blockers encountered: None
- Files changed:
  - src/main.tsx
