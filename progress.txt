## Session: Task 2 (RepoItem component)

### Tasks completed
- Completed Task 2: Implement RepoItem component with status fetching
- All 4 subtasks checked off (were already implemented)

### Decisions made and why
- Verified existing implementation meets all requirements:
  - useRepoStatus hook correctly uses useQuery with checkStatus from Git service
  - Status indicators use color coding (synced: green, modified: yellow, missing: red, loading: gray, error: red)
  - isSelected prop applies highlighting style with theme.bg[3]
  - Repository name is derived from URL using parseGithubUrlSync function

### Blockers encountered
- None - implementation was already complete

### Files changed
- None (existing implementation verified and accepted)

### Verification
- TypeScript type check: ✅ Passed
- Lint: ✅ Passed (1 warning, 0 errors)
- Tests: ✅ Passed (10 pass, 0 fail)
