Project initialized with Ralph workflow.

- Created `plan.md` - project plan and tasks
- Created `progress.txt` - progress tracking log

Next: Begin working on first task.

---

Tasks completed in this session:
- Created `src/components/layout.tsx` - Layout component with Header, Content (flex-grow), and Footer sections
- Created `src/components/keybind-bar.tsx` - KeybindBar footer component displaying available actions
- Refactored `src/app.tsx` to use the new Layout wrapper with header and footer

Decisions made and why:
- Used OpenTUI's flexbox model with `flexDirection="column"`, `flexGrow={1}` for content area, and `flexShrink={0}` for header/footer
- KeybindBar displays primary actions (Navigate, Sync, Sync All, Quit) with visual distinction using colors
- Header shows app title with accent color and subtitle in dimmed color

Files changed:
- src/app.tsx
- src/components/layout.tsx (new)
- src/components/keybind-bar.tsx (new)

---

Tasks completed in this session:
- Refactored `src/components/repo-item.tsx` - Applied justifyContent="space-between", split owner/repo with visual hierarchy

Decisions made and why:
- Owner displayed in dimmed gray (theme.grays[1]) for visual hierarchy, repo in bright white
- Used space-between layout to push status badge to right side
- Removed unused imports (TextAttributes, useKeyboard, match) to keep code clean

Blockers encountered:
- Initial edit corrupted the file; rewrote the entire component to fix

Files changed:
- src/components/repo-item.tsx

---

Tasks completed in this session:
- Marked Visual Hierarchy task as complete in plan.md - Applied specific theme colors (dim gray for owner, bright white for repo name) as specified in the implementation

Decisions made and why:
- Verified that repo-item.tsx already implements the Visual Hierarchy requirements correctly (owner in theme.grays[1], repo in theme.fg[0])
- Only needed to mark the task as complete rather than implement new code

Blockers encountered:
- None

Files changed:
- plan.md (checked off Visual Hierarchy task)

---

Tasks completed in this session:
- Ran type checks, tests, and lint - all passed successfully
- TypeScript: No errors
- Tests: 23 pass, 0 fail
- Lint: 0 warnings, 0 errors

Tasks completed in this session:
- Added borders to Layout component - Added `border={true}` to the main content area to frame the repo list with box-drawing characters

Decisions made and why:
- Used OpenTUI's simple `border={true}` prop which adds a single-line border around the content area
- The border frames the repo list, creating visual separation from the header and footer areas
- This approach is clean and follows the "Refined Industrial" aesthetic - minimal yet structured

Blockers encountered:
- Initially attempted to use individual side borders (borderLeft, borderRight, etc.) which don't exist in OpenTUI's BoxProps
- Resolved by using the simple `border={true}` which applies a full border around the content box

Files changed:
- src/components/layout.tsx (border added to content box)

---

Tasks completed in this session:
- Tuned padding and margins across the UI for the "Refined Industrial" aesthetic
- Added internal padding to content area (inside border) with padding={1} on all sides
- Added vertical padding (paddingTop=1, paddingBottom=1) to RepoItem for visual spacing between items
- Increased header paddingTop to 2 for better proportions
- Increased footer paddingBottom to 2 for better proportions
- Removed redundant paddingTop from app.tsx footer (now handled by Layout)

Decisions made and why:
- Content area padding prevents items from touching the border, creating breathing room
- RepoItem vertical padding creates clear visual separation between list items
- Extra header top padding (2 vs 1) gives the title more breathing room
- Extra footer bottom padding (2 vs 1) gives the keybind bar breathing room from the terminal edge
- Removed redundant app.tsx paddingTop since Layout now handles consistent footer padding

Blockers encountered:
- None

Files changed:
- src/components/layout.tsx (added content padding, adjusted header/footer padding)
- src/components/repo-item.tsx (added vertical padding)
- src/app.tsx (removed redundant footer padding)
- plan.md (checked off Padding & Margins task)
