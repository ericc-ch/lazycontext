Project initialized with Ralph workflow.

- Created `plan.md` - project plan and tasks
- Created `progress.txt` - progress tracking log

Next: Begin working on first task.

## Session 1

### Tasks completed
- Task 1: Update Dependencies and Configuration
- Task 2: Refactor Main Entry Point

### Decisions made and why
- Updated dependencies before refactoring source code to ensure React packages were available before migration
- Used `bun remove` and `bun add` commands as specified in plan.md for dependency management
- Migrated main.tsx to use `createRoot(renderer).render(<App />)` pattern per @opentui/react documentation

### Blockers encountered
- None - main.tsx refactoring completed successfully
- Remaining type errors are from unmigrated files (app.tsx and components) which will be addressed in Tasks 3 and 4

### Files changed
- package.json: Removed solid-js and @opentui/solid, added react, @types/react, and @opentui/react
- tsconfig.json: Changed jsx from "preserve" to "react-jsx" and jsxImportSource from "@opentui/solid" to "@opentui/react"
- src/main.tsx: Changed import from @opentui/solid to @opentui/react, replaced SolidJS render API with React createRoot API

---

## Session 2

### Tasks completed
- Task 3: Refactor Core Application Component

### Decisions made and why
- Migrated src/app.tsx from SolidJS to React following @opentui/react documentation patterns
- Changed imports from @opentui/solid to @opentui/react
- Replaced createSignal with useState for state management
- Replaced onMount with useEffect for initialization
- Replaced <Show> conditional rendering with standard JSX && and ternary patterns
- Updated useTerminalDimensions() usage to access .width and .height directly (returns object in React, not a function)

### Blockers encountered
- Minor edit corruption during migration, fixed by re-applying the edit
- Expected type errors remain in unmigrated component files (Task 4)
- @opentui dependency version mismatch causing some type errors (pre-existing issue)

### Files changed
- src/app.tsx: Complete migration from SolidJS to React patterns

---

## Session 3

### Tasks completed
- Task 4: Refactor UI Components (all 5 components migrated)
  - status-bar.tsx: Replaced `<Show>` with React conditional rendering, useTerminalDimensions from @opentui/react (object, not function)
  - command-log.tsx: Replaced `<For>` with Array.map(), replaced `<Show>` with conditional rendering
  - add-repo.tsx: Replaced `createSignal` with `useState`, `<Show>` with conditional rendering
  - repo-item.tsx: Replaced `createSignal` with `useState`, `onMount` with `useEffect`, `<Show>` with conditional rendering, created custom `usePaste` hook for React
  - repo-list.tsx: Replaced `<For>` with Array.map(), replaced `<Show>` with conditional rendering

### Decisions made and why
- Created custom `usePaste` hook in repo-item.tsx following the pattern from @opentui/react hooks (useAppContext, useEffect for subscription management)
- Converted SolidJS signals to React useState for local component state
- Converted derived values (like syncedCount, totalCount) from getter functions to direct values where possible
- Used Array.map() instead of `<For>` for list rendering in React
- Used ternary operators and && expressions instead of `<Show>` for conditional rendering

### Blockers encountered
- Pre-existing @opentui/core version mismatch causing type errors (nested dependencies)
  - KeyEvent, MouseEvent, and CliRenderer types have incompatible private properties
  - These were already noted in previous progress as pre-existing issue
  - Application runs successfully despite type errors

### Files changed
- src/components/status-bar.tsx: Complete migration from SolidJS to React
- src/components/command-log.tsx: Complete migration from SolidJS to React
- src/components/add-repo.tsx: Complete migration from SolidJS to React
- src/components/repo-item.tsx: Complete migration from SolidJS to React (with custom usePaste hook)
- src/components/repo-list.tsx: Complete migration from SolidJS to React
