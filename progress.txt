2026-01-18 (continued):
- Tasks completed:
  - Task 2: Define Atom State - Created src/state/atoms.ts with all required atoms
- Decisions made:
  - Used make(initialValue) function from @effect-atom/atom/Atom to create atoms
  - Used withLabel(atom, name) combinator to add descriptive labels to atoms
  - Defined Status type as "synced" | "modified" | "missing"
  - Created atoms for repos, statuses, view, selectedIndex, editingIndex, and editingUrl
- Blockers encountered:
  - Initially tried wrong API syntax (Atom({ id, default })) - adjusted to match effect-atom's actual API
- Files changed:
  - src/state/atoms.ts (new file)
