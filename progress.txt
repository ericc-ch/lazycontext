## Session 1: Task 1 - Refactor app.tsx

### Tasks Completed
- Refactored `src/app.tsx` to use React state (`useState`) instead of Effect atoms
- Removed all `@effect-atom/atom-react` imports
- Removed `Config` and `Git` service imports
- Removed all `serverRuntime.runPromise` calls
- Implemented placeholder data for repos and statuses
- Implemented dummy `loadConfig`, `handleAddRepo`, `handleSyncRepo`, and `handleSyncAll` functions

### Decisions Made
- Defined `Repo` and `Status` types locally in app.tsx for clarity
- Used `Record<string, Status>` instead of `Map` for statuses state
- Converted to `Map` only when passing to `RepoList` component (which expects Map)
- Implemented simple URL parsing using regex instead of Effect-based `parseGithubUrl`
- Placeholder repos: "effect" and "opentui" with "synced" and "modified" statuses

### Blockers Encountered
- None for this task

### Files Changed
- `src/app.tsx` - Complete refactor from Effect atoms to React state
