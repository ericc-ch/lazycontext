## Session 1

### Tasks completed
- Task 1: Update Dependencies and Configuration
- Task 2: Refactor Main Entry Point

### Decisions made and why
- Updated dependencies before refactoring source code to ensure React packages were available before migration
- Used `bun remove` and `bun add` commands as specified in plan.md for dependency management
- Migrated main.tsx to use `createRoot(renderer).render(<App />)` pattern per @opentui/react documentation

### Blockers encountered
- None - main.tsx refactoring completed successfully
- Remaining type errors are from unmigrated files (app.tsx and components) which will be addressed in Tasks 3 and 4

### Files changed
- package.json: Removed solid-js and @opentui/solid, added react, @types/react, and @opentui/react
- tsconfig.json: Changed jsx from "preserve" to "react-jsx" and jsxImportSource from "@opentui/solid" to "@opentui/react"
- src/main.tsx: Changed import from @opentui/solid to @opentui/react, replaced SolidJS render API with React createRoot API
