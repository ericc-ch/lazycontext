Project initialized with Ralph workflow.

- Created `plan.md` - project plan and tasks
- Created `progress.txt` - progress tracking log

Next: Begin working on first task.

## Session: Task 2 (RepoItem component)

### Tasks completed
- Completed Task 2: Implement RepoItem component with status fetching
- All 4 subtasks checked off (were already implemented)

### Decisions made and why
- Verified existing implementation meets all requirements:
  - useRepoStatus hook correctly uses useQuery with checkStatus from Git service
  - Status indicators use color coding (synced: green, modified: yellow, missing: red, loading: gray, error: red)
  - isSelected prop applies highlighting style with theme.bg[3]
  - Repository name is derived from URL using parseGithubUrlSync function

### Blockers encountered
- None - implementation was already complete

### Files changed
- None (existing implementation verified and accepted)

### Verification
- TypeScript type check: ✅ Passed
- Lint: ✅ Passed (1 warning, 0 errors)
- Tests: ✅ Passed (10 pass, 0 fail)

## Session: Task 3 (clone/pull mutations with keyboard shortcuts)

### Tasks completed
- Completed Task 3: Implement clone/pull mutations with keyboard shortcuts
- All 5 subtasks implemented:
  - Created `useSyncRepo` hook using `useMutation` for clone/pull operations
  - Added cache invalidation for `["repo-status", url]` after successful sync
  - Implemented `repo-sync` keybinding (Enter) handling in RepoList keyboard handler
  - Added syncing state display with "Cloning..." / "Pulling..." text
  - Added syncing prop to RepoItem to disable interactions during mutation

### Decisions made and why
- Used Effect.runPromise instead of runSync for async git operations to properly handle Effect's error channel
- Used `void` keyword for Promise-returning functions to satisfy lint (invalidateQueries and handleSync)
- Created new RegExp object for URL parsing to fix lint warning about escape characters
- Added "syncing" status type to RepoStatus union for proper type safety
- Used syncingUrl state in RepoList to track which repo is being synced, passed to RepoItem for visual feedback

### Blockers encountered
- Initial implementation had duplicate try-catch blocks causing syntax errors - fixed by rewriting the file
- Had to refactor handleSync from using runtime.runSync to Effect.runPromise pattern to properly use yield*

### Files changed
- src/components/repo-item.tsx:
  - Added useSyncRepo hook with useMutation for clone/pull operations
  - Added syncing status type and getStatusColor/getStatusText support
  - Added syncing, syncType, onSync props to RepoItemProps
  - Updated RepoItem to handle syncing state
  - Fixed URL regex using new RegExp to avoid lint warning

- src/components/repo-list.tsx:
  - Added Git import and RepoStatus type import
  - Added syncingUrl and syncType state
  - Added handleSync function with Effect pattern
  - Added repo-sync keybinding handling in useKeyboard
  - Passed syncing and syncType props to RepoItem

### Verification
- TypeScript type check: ✅ Passed
- Lint: ✅ Passed (0 warnings, 0 errors)
- Tests: ✅ Passed (10 pass, 0 fail)

## Session: Task 4 (visual styling and layout)

### Tasks completed
- Completed Task 4: Add visual styling and layout
- All 5 subtasks implemented:
  - Added hover effect using onMouseOver/onMouseOut props with subtle background color (theme.bg[2])
  - Added text truncation with `truncate={true}` for long repo names
  - Verified existing styling: selected item uses theme.bg[3], status indicator on right side with color + symbol
  - Confirmed consistent spacing (padding: 1) and typography (bold for selected)

### Decisions made and why
- Used React useState to track hover state since OpenTUI doesn't have built-in hover props
- Leveraged BoxRenderable's onMouseOver/onMouseOut event handlers from @opentui/core Renderable class
- Used theme.bg[2] for hover background to create subtle distinction from selected state
- Applied truncate prop to text component following patterns from OpenTUI text-truncation-demo

### Blockers encountered
- None - researched OpenTUI API to find mouse event handlers and truncate prop support

### Files changed
- src/components/repo-item.tsx:
  - Added isHovered state with useState
  - Added onMouseOver and onMouseOut props to main box for hover detection
  - Added hoverBackgroundColor using theme.bg[2]
  - Applied truncate={true} to repo name text element for ellipsis on overflow

### Verification
- TypeScript type check: ✅ Passed
- Lint: ✅ Passed (0 warnings, 0 errors)
- Tests: ✅ Passed (10 pass, 0 fail)
