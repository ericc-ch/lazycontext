## Session 1: Task 1 - Remove all logging statements

**Tasks completed:**
- Removed all orphaned `logger.command` and `logger.success` calls from `src/services/git.ts` (4 calls total)
- Verified no logging statements remain in the modified file
- Ran tests: 10/10 tests pass

**Decisions made:**
- Removed dead logger calls that were missing `yield*` prefix (orphaned calls)
- The logger service (`src/services/logger.ts`) has separate pre-existing issues unrelated to this task

**Files changed:**
- `src/services/git.ts` - removed 4 logger calls

**Type check / lint results:**
- Tests: 10 pass, 0 fail
- Typecheck: Pre-existing errors in other files (logger.ts, app.tsx)
- Lint: Pre-existing warnings in logger.ts only
