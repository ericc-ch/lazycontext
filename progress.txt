Project initialized with Ralph workflow.

- Created `plan.md` - project plan and tasks
- Created `progress.txt` - progress tracking log

Next: Begin working on first task.

## Session 1

### Tasks completed in this session
- Fixed type errors in `src/services/git.ts` by adding `as const` assertions to `checkStatus` return values to match the `readonly` `RepoStatus` schema types
- Fixed type guard `isRepoStatus` in `src/components/repo-item.tsx` to use proper type narrowing with `typeof status === "object"` check instead of `in` operator
- Fixed test errors in `src/services/git.test.ts` by adding proper type checks for `unknown` error types using `instanceof Error` guards

### Decisions made and why
- Added `as const` assertions to git.ts return values: The `RepoStatus` schema uses `readonly` properties, but the `checkStatus` function was returning plain objects. Using `as const` makes the returned objects have `readonly` properties, matching the schema type.
- Changed type guard implementation: The `in` operator wasn't working correctly with union. Using `typeof status === "object" && types in TypeScript status !== null && "state" in status` properly narrows the type.
- Used `instanceof Error` for error type checking: Bun's test framework requires proper type narrowing for `unknown` types before calling methods like `toString()`.

### Blockers encountered
- None significant; type system issues were resolved by proper type narrowing and const assertions.

### Files changed
- `src/services/git.ts` - Added `as const` assertions to return values
- `src/components/repo-item.tsx` - Fixed type guard implementation
- `src/services/git.test.ts` - Added type guards for error handling
