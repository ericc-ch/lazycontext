2026-01-18 (continued):
- Tasks completed:
  - Task 2: Define Atom State - Created src/state/atoms.ts with all required atoms
- Decisions made:
  - Used make(initialValue) function from @effect-atom/atom/Atom to create atoms
  - Used withLabel(atom, name) combinator to add descriptive labels to atoms
  - Defined Status type as "synced" | "modified" | "missing"
  - Created atoms for repos, statuses, view, selectedIndex, editingIndex, and editingUrl
- Blockers encountered:
  - Initially tried wrong API syntax (Atom({ id, default })) - adjusted to match effect-atom's actual API
- Files changed:
  - src/state/atoms.ts (new file)

2026-01-18:
- Tasks completed:
  - Task 3 (subtask): Migrate add-repo.tsx - Replaced useState with local atoms
- Decisions made:
  - Created local atoms (AddRepoUrlAtom, AddRepoStatusAtom, AddRepoErrorAtom) for component-local state
  - Used useAtom hook from @effect-atom/atom-react for state management
  - Added URL validation using Effect.runPromiseExit with parseGithubUrl
  - Kept local state since AddRepo form state is not shared with other components
- Blockers encountered:
  - None
- Files changed:
  - src/components/add-repo.tsx
