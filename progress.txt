2026-01-18 (continued):
- Tasks completed:
  - Task 2: Define Atom State - Created src/state/atoms.ts with all required atoms
- Decisions made:
  - Used make(initialValue) function from @effect-atom/atom/Atom to create atoms
  - Used withLabel(atom, name) combinator to add descriptive labels to atoms
  - Defined Status type as "synced" | "modified" | "missing"
  - Created atoms for repos, statuses, view, selectedIndex, editingIndex, and editingUrl
- Blockers encountered:
  - Initially tried wrong API syntax (Atom({ id, default })) - adjusted to match effect-atom's actual API
- Files changed:
  - src/state/atoms.ts (new file)

2026-01-18:
- Tasks completed:
  - Task 4: Migrate App Component - Replaced useState/useEffect with effect-atom hooks
  - Task 2: Define Atom State - Checked off subtasks (atoms.ts was already created)
- Decisions made:
  - Used useAtom hook from @effect-atom/atom-react for all atom interactions
  - Kept async logic inline in App component (following add-repo.tsx pattern)
  - All state updates use atom setters with functional updates for Map states
- Blockers encountered:
  - Initial misunderstanding of effect-atom API - atoms don't have .get()/.set() methods directly
  - Resolved by using useAtom hook which returns [value, setValue] tuples
- Files changed:
  - src/app.tsx (refactored from useState to useAtom)
  - plan.md (checked off Task 2 subtasks and Task 4)

2026-01-18:
- Tasks completed:
  - Task 3 (subtask): Migrate repo-item.tsx - Replaced useState with local atoms
- Decisions made:
  - Created local atoms (RepoItemEditUrlAtom, RepoItemParseErrorAtom) for component-local state
  - Used useAtom hook from @effect-atom/atom-react for state management
  - Followed same pattern as add-repo.tsx for consistency
  - Kept useEffect for paste event handler registration (not related to state)
- Blockers encountered:
  - None
- Files changed:
  - src/components/repo-item.tsx
  - plan.md (checked off Task 3 subtask)
