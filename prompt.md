0. Read plan.md and progress.txt to understand the state of the project.
1. Find the highest-priority task to work on (not necessarily first in list).
2. Explore .context/ to find examples and patterns needed to implement the task.
3. Work ONLY on that single task until complete.
4. After completing a task, reread the whole file and review.
5. Run type checks, tests, and lint (if available).
6. Update plan.md to check off completed items with [x].
7. Append your progress to progress.txt (append only, don't overwrite previous entries).
8. Make a git commit for that task.
   ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK. YOU ARE DONE AFTER THAT SINGLE TASK IS COMPLETE.
   If plan.md is fully complete (all items checked), output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
